# Pocket DevOps Challenge.

In this repository you will find the structure of an extremely simple application.

You have been handed this code by one of the new developers on the team, and asked
to help get it working.

We are using Docker, and your main entry point here will a docker-compose.yml file.

The developer is *very* new to Docker and is quite sure they got the docker-compose.yml
file wrong.

What they would LIKE to have happen, is a MySQL container starts up ready to accept 
connections, from a second container, nodeApp, running some nodeJS code.  Note that
this nodeJS code isn't currently written.

Find and document issues in the docker-compose.yml file.  Syntax mistakes, incorrect
definitions, etc.  Whatever might be preventing first, the containers from starting,
second, the nodeApp from working.  Any comments on how this could be improved are
also welcome.   

Generally just use this is a blank canvas to show us what you know, or can do, in 
the allotted time!

Please keep your time spent on this task to 30 minutes or less.  

When complete, go ahead and create a Pull Request with your changes!
